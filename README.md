#  Memora

A React-based photo gallery web application to upload, view, filter, and sort your  memories. The app allows users to upload photos, add titles, descriptions, and tags, and browse them in different view modes with filtering and sorting options.

## ‚ùì Why Memora?

In a world overflowing with photos, it's easy to lose track of the moments that matter. From travel pictures buried in phone storage to family events mixed up in cloud folders, managing memories has become frustrating.

### üß© The Problem

- Disorganized photo folders across devices and platforms  
- Lack of context ‚Äî no titles, tags, or descriptions to recall the story  
- Hard to find specific memories

- **Upload** your moments  
- **Describe** them with metadata
